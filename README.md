This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Countdown Timer Project

This project was a practice to further enhance my skills using React and Javascript. 


## User interactive options

The page provides an input bar and three buttons. With the input bar you can set the time in minutes to start the countdown. By clicking the start button the timer will begin. By pressing the pause or reset button the timer will stop or go to time 0:00 respectively. 


### `npm start`
The app can only be run in development mode after inputting the commade `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
